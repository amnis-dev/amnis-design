## Philosophy

There's a lot to consider when designing a web application, and even more with accessibility and user experience in mind.

Complying to accessibility standards is complex, redundant, and sometimes confusing for common interfaces. Much like having to manage your memory in some low-level languages, it can be extraordinarily difficult to master proper implementation and catch issues when they inevitably arise.

This design system focuses on delivering modern methods that abstract and bundle accessibility and user experience implementations (provided by the [WCAG 2 Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/)) for desktop and mobile environments: easing the efforts to a better web for all internet users.

This library is inspired by qualities from both the [U.S. Web Design System](https://github.com/uswds/uswds) and [MUI Core](https://github.com/mui/material-ui).

For U.S. federal sites, this library should also help legal compliance with [Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act (29 U.S.C. ยง794d)](https://www.access-board.gov/law/ra.html#section-508-federal-electronic-and-information-technology). There are many other [governmental policies](https://www.w3.org/WAI/policies/) this library can help achieve. You should always provide your own testing to ensure you meet your specific requirements.
